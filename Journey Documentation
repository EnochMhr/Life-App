then tommorow i will work on the homepage and the other few pages that are poresent in the app for both android small and large screens

as the team of 5, each of us is designing these mockups and on the 3rd of march we will vet the different designs and then come up with a final template for the app

started working on the homepage from saturday around 11pm and have just finished the mockups for small and large android screens at 3pm

its really exhausting am just going to sleepnow and then we meet as the team tommorrow to discuss the UIs each of us has and then finally come up with a proper design template
